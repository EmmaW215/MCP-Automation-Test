MCP Automation Test
Summary of Completed Tasks
Date: October 26, 2025
Workspace: Emma W's Notion
Purpose: Testing Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugins for automation workflows

1. GitHub Integration Test ‚úÖ
Plugin Used: GitHub MCP
Task: Connect to GitHub account and retrieve latest commits from repository
Details:

Repository: github.com/EmmaW215/n8n
Action: Listed the 5 most recent commits
Results: Successfully retrieved commits from October 24, 2025

Key Commits Retrieved:

docs: Fix API docs for credential transfer (#21171) - Marc Littlemore
fix(editor): Close NDV on AI Builder message (#21158) - Oleg Ivaniv
fix(editor): Fix SaveButton event emission (#21154) - Alex Grozav

test: Migrate projects spec from cypress to playwright (#21128) - Artem Sorokin

Status: ‚úÖ Successful - Full commit details including SHA, author, timestamp, and commit messages retrieved

2. Puppeteer Web Automation Test ‚úÖ
Plugin Used: Puppeteer MCP
Task: Navigate to a website and capture a full-page screenshot
Details:

Target URL: https://www.inference.ai/
Action: Automated browser navigation and screenshot capture
Screenshot Name: example.png
Resolution: 1920x1080 pixels

Content Captured:

Inference AI homepage
Hero section with "Get Your Fractionalized GPUs" headline
GPU virtualization messaging
"Access the Console" call-to-action button
Dark gradient background (black to purple/magenta)

Status: ‚úÖ Successful - High-quality screenshot captured and displayed

3. File System Operations Test ‚ö†Ô∏è
Plugin Used: Filesystem API (Browser-based)
Task: Create a folder named mcp_test on Desktop with a hello.txt file containing "Hello MCP!"
Details:

Requested Action: Create folder structure on local filesystem
Challenge Encountered: Browser security restrictions prevent direct filesystem access
Solution Provided: Created HTML artifact with download functionality

Alternative Solution:

Built interactive web interface for file download
Provided step-by-step instructions for manual folder creation
Enabled user to download hello.txt file with correct content

Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - Local filesystem access not available due to security constraints, workaround provided
Key Learning: MCP plugins running in browser environments cannot access local filesystem directly without explicit user permissions

4. Sequential Thinking Analysis ‚úÖ
Plugin Used: REPL/Analysis Tool (JavaScript)
Task: Create a step-by-step plan for technical interview preparation
Details:

Method: Sequential thinking with logical phase breakdown
Output Format: Comprehensive 20-step plan across 5 phases
Timeline: 8-week preparation schedule
Customization: Tailored to RF/Telecom engineer transitioning to AI domain

Plan Structure:
Phase 1: Assessment & Planning (Week 1)

Role understanding
Self-assessment
Timeline planning
Resource gathering

Phase 2: Knowledge Building (Weeks 2-4)

Core fundamentals review
Domain-specific skills (Python, ML, AI frameworks)
Product management integration
Industry knowledge

Phase 3: Practice & Application (Weeks 5-7)

Coding practice (100+ problems)
System design practice
Mock interviews
Project review preparation
Behavioral interview prep

Phase 4: Final Preparation (Week 8)

Weak areas review
Company-specific research
Technical environment setup
Materials organization

Phase 5: Interview Day

Pre-interview routine
During interview best practices
Post-interview follow-up

Daily Schedule Included:

Morning: Algorithm problems (1 hour)
Lunch: Concept review (30 min)
Evening: System design/projects (1 hour)
Weekend: Mock interviews and review

Status: ‚úÖ Successful - Comprehensive, actionable plan created with specific metrics and timeline

5. Notion Integration Test üìù
Plugin Used: Notion MCP
Task: Create a new page titled 'MCP Automation Test' with task summaries
Details:

Workspace: Emma W's Notion
Bot: MLE_Claude
Action Attempted: Create new page with automation summary
Challenge: Requires parent page ID for page creation

Workspace Information Retrieved:

Workspace ID: 0ecfc621-49ca-81e9-a410-000396871790
Workspace Name: Emma W's Notion
Bot ID: fc681c72-4d16-4436-b9d6-ea514fbf6dc5
Max file upload size: 5MB

Alternative Delivered:

Created comprehensive Markdown document
Can be manually imported to Notion
Contains all task summaries and results

Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - Workspace connected, but parent page ID needed for content creation

Key Insights
What Worked Well:

GitHub Integration - Seamless API access with proper authentication
Puppeteer Automation - Reliable browser control and screenshot capture
Sequential Analysis - Complex problem-solving with structured output
Notion Connection - Bot successfully authenticated to workspace

Limitations Identified:

Local Filesystem Access - Browser security prevents direct desktop file operations
Notion Page Creation - Requires existing page structure (parent page ID)

Recommendations:

For filesystem operations, consider server-side MCP implementations
For Notion, prepare parent page IDs in advance or use database entries
GitHub and Puppeteer plugins are production-ready for automation workflows
Sequential thinking/analysis tools excellent for planning and documentation


Technical Environment

Interface: Claude.ai with MCP plugin support
Date: October 26, 2025
User Profile: RF/Telecom Engineer ‚Üí AI Domain
Coding Language: Python (primary)
Background: Agile Product Management experience


Next Steps

‚úÖ Import this summary to Notion manually or provide parent page ID
Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated commit summaries
Explore Puppeteer for regular website monitoring
Use sequential thinking approach for other project planning tasks
Set up Notion database structure for better MCP integration
